        Hazard Description: The hazard of 'Water being spilt on the floor' during the activity 'Fluids laboratory' can lead to injuries caused by possible slipping on a wet floor to students.
        Hazard Event Description: Water is accidentally spilled on the floor.
        Prevention Explanation: 'Keeping the water tank stationary when it's full' reduces the likelihood of spilling water as moving it increases the likelihood of water being spilled; as it reduces the likelihood of the hazard event, it is a prevention measure.
        Mitigation Explanation: If water has been spilled on the floor, 'not moving the water tank when it is full' does not remove or reduce the harm caused by the hazard event, as the water is already spilled and poses a slipping hazard; as it does not reduce the harm caused by the hazard event, it is not a mitigation measure.

        Hazard Description: The hazard of 'Loud noise' during the activity 'Using a trombone as a demonstration for a TPS presentation' can cause hearing damage to everyone present.
        Hazard Event Description: The trombone player plays the instrument at a high volume, producing a loud noise.
        Prevention Explanation: 'Keeping a space between the player and the audience' does not reduce the likelihood of the trombone producing a loud noise. As it does not reduce the likelihood of the hazard event, it is not a prevention measure.
        Mitigation Explanation: If the hazard event occurs and the trombone produces a loud noise, 'keeping a space between the player and the audience' will reduce the noise heard by the audience, hence reducing the severity of the hearing damage caused by the loud noise; as it reduces the harm caused by the hazard event, it is a mitigation measure.
        Answer: Mitigation.

        2. Describe the hazard event, which is the event that leads to harm.
        3. Explain whether or not 'Keep safe distance between the snowman and audience' reduces the likelihood that the hazard event occurs.
        If so, it is a prevention measure.
        4. Assuming the hazard event occurs, explain whether or not 'Keep safe distance between the snowman and audience' removes or reduces the harm caused by the event.
        If so, it is a mitigation measure.
        5. If it is a prevention measure, answer 'Prevention'. If it is a migitation meausure, answer 'Mitigation'.
        If it is neither a prevention measure nor a mitigation measure, answer 'Neither'. If it is both a        
        prevention measure and a mitigation measure, answer 'Both'.

        Hazard Description: The hazard of 'Allergies' during the activity 'Showing an artificial snowman for a TPS presentation' can lead to contact with the artificial snow (polymers) causing allergies to the audience.
        Hazard Event Description: An audience member allergic to the artificial snow comes into contact with it.
        Prevention Explanation: 'Keeping a safe distance between the snowman and the audience' reduces the likelihood that an allergic audience member comes into contact with the artificial snow; as it reduces the likelihood of the hazard event, it is therefore a prevention measure.
        Mitigation Explanation: If an allergic audience member comes into contact with the artificial snow, 'keeping a safe distance between the snowman and the audience' will not remove or reduce the harm caused by the allergies as the allergic reaction has already been caused; as it does not reduce the harm caused by the hazard event, it is not a mitigation measure.
        Answer: Prevention.

        2. Describe the hazard event, which is the event that leads to harm.
        3. Explain whether or not 'Wear lab coat and PPE' reduces the likelihood that the hazard event occurs.   
        If so, it is a prevention measure.
        4. Assuming the hazard event occurs, explain whether or not 'Wear lab coat and PPE' removes or reduces the harm caused by the event.
        If so, it is a mitigation measure.
        5. If it is a prevention measure, answer 'Prevention'. If it is a migitation meausure, answer 'Mitigation'.
        If it is neither a prevention measure nor a mitigation measure, answer 'Neither'. If it is both a        
        prevention measure and a mitigation measure, answer 'Both'.

        Hazard Description: The hazard of 'Syringes with sharp needles' during the activity 'Fluids laboratory' can lead to sharp needles piercing the skin and causing bleeding to students.
        Hazard Event Description: A sharp syringe needle is directed towards an student.
        Prevention Explanation: 'Wearing a lab coat and personal protective equipment (PPE)' does not reduce the likelihood of a student directing a syringe needle towards another student; as it does not reduce the likelihood of the hazard event, it is therefore not a prevention measure.
        Mitigation Explanation: If a sharp syringe needle is directed towards a student, 'wearing a lab coat and PPE' will reduce the harm caused by the sharp needle as it is unlikely to pierce through the lab coat and PPE; as it reduces the harm caused by the hazard event, it is a mitigation measure.
        Answer: Mitigation.

        prevention measure and a mitigation measure, answer 'Both'.
        
        Hazard Description: The hazard of 'Water from instrument' during the activity 'Using a trombone as a demonstration for a TPS presentation' can lead to the spread of germs to the audience if condensation formed in the instrument is released.
        Hazard Event Description: Water from the trombone condenses and is released into the air.
        Prevention Explanation: 'Keeping a space between the player and the audience' does not reduce the likelihood of water condensing in the instrument or being released; as it does not reduce the likelihood of the hazard event, it is not a prevention measure.
        Mitigation Explanation: If water from the instrument is released, 'keeping a space between the player and the audience' will mean that fewer germs reach the audience members so will reduce the harm caused by the spread of germs; as it reduces the harm caused by the hazard event, it is a mitigation measure.

        Example Input:
        Follow these instructions:
        1. In one sentence, describe the hazard: 'Ink spillage' during the
        activity: 'Fluids laboratory' given how the hazard harms: 'Serious eye damage'
        and who the hazard harms: 'Students'.
        2. In one sentence, explain why "Serious eye damage" is a way that this hazard can cause harm.
        3. Explain whether or not 'First aid' reduces the likelihood that the hazard causes harm.
        If so, it is a prevention measure.

        Output: 
        Description: The hazard of 'Ink spillage' during the activity 'Fluids laboratory' can lead to serious eye damage to students.
        How it Harms Explanation: 'Serious eye damage' is a way that this hazard causes harm because if ink comes into contact with the eyes, it can cause serious damage.
        Prevention Explanation: First aid will not reduce the likelihood of an ink spillage causing harm and it is a reactive step taken after the ink spillage; it therefore does not reduce the likelihood that the hazard causes harm and is not a prevention measure.
        Mitigation Explanation: If an ink spillage has led to serious eye damagen, first aid will help to wash the ink out of the eyes and reduce eye damage; as it reduces the harm, it is therefore a mitigation measure.
        Answer: Mitigation.'''

        Output:
        Description: The hazard of 'Horse kicks out' during the activity 'Mucking out a horse' can lead to impact injury to the horse rider.
        How it Harms Explanation: When a horse kicks out during mucking out, it can cause harm through impact injury, as the force of the kick can lead to bruises, fractures, or other injuries.
        Prevention Explanation: Wearing a helmet and body protector does not reduce the likelihood that the horse will kick and is therefore not a prevention measure.
        Mitigation Explanation: If a horse kicks the horse rider, wearing a helmet and body protector provides a protective barrier between the horse's kick and the person, hence reducing the impact injury caused by the horse's kick; as it reduces the harm, it is therefore a mitigation measure.
        Answer: Mitigation.

        Output:
        Description: The hazard of 'Tripping over personal belongings' during the activity 'Fluids laboratory' can lead to physical harm to students.
        How it Harms Explanation: Tripping can cause physical harm because it can result in falls, which can lead to injuries such as bruises, sprains, or fractures.
        Prevention Explanation: 'Take care when walking around' encourages students to be cautions and aware of their surroundings, making it less likely they will trip so it is a prevention measure.
        Mitigation Explanation: If a student has tripped over personal belongings, whether or not they were taking care when walking around will not affect how much harm the trip; as it does not reduce harm, it is therefore not a mitigation measure.
